- 👋 Hey, I am Julius, a 24 years old software development student from Helsinki!
I'm currently enrolled at Haaga-Helia UAS.

- 👀 I’m mostly interested in web development and Javascript frameworks. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about IoT devices and micro controllers such as Arduino and ESP32. 

- 💞️ I'd love to collaborate to a bigger open-source project in near future.
